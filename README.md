# chess
Unfinished simulation of a game of chess. Basically an extended exercise in classes and inheritance. So far I've worked out all the move sets and the mechanism for attacking other pieces. All that remains is to implement a .is_in_check() method for the king, and a play_game() function that will allow two players to actually use the program to play the game, hopefully in a user-friendly manner.
